Having a range of tools available to you with easy access will make it easier for you to navigate the Web3 (Web 3.0) world. Web3 is basically an evolved version of the internet as we know it, based around decentralization and blockchain technology.

In the crypto space, there are hundreds of tools that exist to make your life easier. Whether it's buying NFTs, staking in DeFi protocols or just looking back at your past transactions - there are tools for each step in the process. It can almost seem overwhelming.

Over the last few months, I've established a list of my favorite intro-level tools that I find myself using on an almost daily basis. But before we get into the recommendations, it's important to understand why having these saved as bookmarks is important.

## Avoid phishing websites that are trying to scam you
In this new Web3 world, [phishing scams](https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/4/22763015/cryptocurrency-fake-wallet-phishing-scam-google-ads-phantom-metamask) are unfortunately common. For this reason, googling the website you want to access each time, or typing in the URL by hand is not the best idea. If you click on a sketchy link or make a 1-letter mistake in typing the domain, you can be visiting an unofficial website and signing off the rights to your entire wallet (just visiting a malicious website wouldn't actually drain your wallet, but sometimes it's hard to notice before it's too late).

To avoid these websites completely, I always recommended creating a bookmarked folder in your web browser called "crypto" that contains all of the websites you plan to access more than once.

## My favorite crypto and Web3 tools

#### [Coinbase](https://coinbase.com/)
Coinbase is one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world. An exchange is what you use to buy crypto with fiat money (US dollars, Euros, etc.). More specifically, Coinbase is a centralized exchange which means it is operated by a single company, is regulated by the government, and requires KYC (Know Your Customer, or basically identity verification). I personally use Coinbase, but other centralized exchanges that offer almost the same functionality are [Gemini](gemini.com), [Binance](https://www.binance.com/), [Kraken](https://www.kraken.com/), [FTX](https://ftx.com/), and the list goes on.

#### [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/)
CoinMarketCap is the easiest way to check the live price of almost any cryptocurrency or token. Along with the live price, it has historic graphs, rankings by market cap, recent volume, and more.

#### [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/)
Etherscan is a blockchain explorer for the Ethereum network. This means that it can show you almost everything that happens on the Ethererum blockchain. Gas prices, wallet activity, metadata on every single transaction, and more. To find the activity of any Ethereum wallet (or ENS name), simply enter their wallet address into the search bar.

#### [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/)
OpenSea is the currently largest NFT Marketplace, and accounts for a significant portion of all ETH network transactions. [Learn how to get started with NFTs](/blog/get-started-with-nfts/).

#### [Rarible Analytics](https://raribleanalytics.com/)
This is my favorite website for checking the live price of gas (post coming soon on what that is). It provides a human-readable scale indicating whether or not it's a good time to make transactions.

#### [Real Vision](https://www.realvision.com/crypto)
Real Vision is a (mostly) free educational platform with dozens of hours of video content from crypto thought leader [Raoul Pal](https://twitter.com/RaoulGMI) and others.

#### [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/)
Earlier I mentioned Coinbase was a centralized exchange - well Uniswap is a decentralized exchange. This means that you have access to trade all tokens on the ETH network - not just what a single company wants to show you. Once you [start using a non-custodial wallet](/blog/get-started-with-nfts/) like MetaMask, you'll be using decentralized exchanges more frequently than centralized ones.

#### [Lido](https://lido.fi/)
Lido is most people's first step into staking cryptocurrency. Staking basically means setting aside your assets to be used by somebody else, and getting paid a return for doing that (yield). Lido is one of the largest and most established DeFi staking protocols out there, and works great with assets like Ethereum and Solana. As of writing this, Lido is paying 4.9% APR for staking Ethereum.

## Other Web3 Resources
The websites I mentioned above are my most used, and/or favorite tools that I've come across in my few months in this space. That being said, those tools won't be very useful without the knowledge needed to use them.

The place I've learned the most about Web3 is undoubtedly Twitter. There's a little niche that people call crypto Twitter - once you're on it, you'll see people post about interesting topics all the time. But getting on to crypto Twitter in the first place is the hard part since you probably don't know who to follow.

To get you started on crypto Twitter, I came up with a list of my favorite thought leaders in the space. You can find that list in my post, [How to Get More Involved in the Crypto and NFT Community](/blog/nft-community/).
